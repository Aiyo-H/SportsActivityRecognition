# SportsActivityRecognition
A Human Activity Recognition Project.

With this repo, you can generate your own dataset and train your dataset to let the model recognize your activity!

Currently 4 recorded activities are available: downward-dog, jumping-jack, leg-up, squat

You can follow the instruction in collectdata.py to record your own one.

Use the training script to train the model(model architecture might need adjustment to recognize complex activity)

Use the real_time_test script to test.
